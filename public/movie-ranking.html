<h2>My TOP 3 Movies</h2>

<hr />

<h3>1. Harry Potter Series</h3>
<p>
  I'm sure everyone has their own childhood memories of reading the Harry Potter
  books that they'll tell their grandkids about, but I'll never forget going to
  see the first movie in the theaters. The lights dimmed, John Williams's
  perfect theme played its first notes as Richard Harris walked down Privet
  Drive, and everyone in the theater was transported to another world. John
  Williams's numerous themes, all wonderful and a personification of the
  wizarding world, took the early movies to another level. As other composers
  tried their hands at the later films, that quality was missing. There's
  something truly special about going to see this movie on the big screen, and
  while the "magical" qualities might not all be credited to the music, it's
  certainly one of them.

<p>
  Welcome to the world of Harry Potter, where if you're a ten-year-old kid who
  doesn't fit in, you might get a letter delivered by an owl telling you you
  have magical powers and should go to a special school to hone them. Believe it
  or not, there are people who watch this movie without reading the books, so a
  bit of description is necessary. Obviously the stars of the show are the
  children, who were selected out of millions of other kids to be able to
  memorize lines, not look in the camera, endear themselves to worldwide
  audiences, and hopefully act. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, and
  Tom Felton are so cute and tiny in this first movie, you'll undoubtedly find
  yourself re-watching it as the years pass just to see them as kids again. I
  always marvel that child actors train themselves not to look in the camera, so
  even if their performances aren't perfect, I cut them slack, knowing firsthand
  how hard it is. And these kids had to dress in funny costumes, recite
  incantations without laughing, and pretend they're looking at things that were
  added in post production!

<h3>2. Hunger Games Series</h3>
<p>The movie was honestly great! I thought it was well done.</p>
<p>
  1. I really loved the casting done of Rue, she is exactly how I imagined Rue.
</p>
<p>
  2. Worldbuilding was fantastic! District 12 and Capitol were completely well
  made. Especially when you compare the two, the Capitol is so bright and modern
  while District 12 looks so old and run down.

<h3>3. Yue Lao</h3>
<p>A very good chinese movie!!!!</p>
